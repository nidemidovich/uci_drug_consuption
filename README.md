# UCI Drug Consumption
This is the repository with my project. Problems that were considered:

1) Multi-label classification for each drug separately
2) Binary classification for each drug separately
3) Binary classification only for ecstasy

Special attention is focused on the third point with a more detailed analysis of the features and with cross-validation.
